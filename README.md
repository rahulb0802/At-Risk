The project develops and tests a novel diffusion index for forecasting U.S. recessions.\n","\n","## Required Libraries\n","All necessary Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. To create the correct environment, run:\n","`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n","\n","## Instructions for Reproducing Results\n","\n","To generate all results from scratch, please run the Jupyter/Colab notebooks in the following numerical order. It is recommended to use \"Runtime -> Restart and run all\" for each notebook to ensure a clean execution.\n","\n","**Step 1: Data Preparation**\n","- **File:** `1_Data_Preparation.ipynb`\n","- **Purpose:** Downloads the latest FRED-MD data, performs initial cleaning, and saves the base data files to the `03_intermediate_data` folder.\n","- **Expected Runtime:** ~1-2 minutes.\n","\n","**Step 2: Recursive Forecasting**\n","- **File:** `2_Recursive_Forecasting.ipynb`\n","- **Purpose:** Runs the main out-of-sample forecasting loop for all models (TFDI, PCA, ADS, etc.) for both the h=1 and h=3 horizons. This is a computationally intensive script.\n","- **Configuration:** Before running, ensure the `FORCE_RERUN_ALL` variable in the configuration cell is set to `True` to generate results from scratch.\n","- **Expected Runtime:** ~4-6 hours.\n","\n","**Step 3: Evaluation and Analysis**\n","- **File:** `3_Evaluation_and_Analysis.ipynb`\n","- **Purpose:** Loads the saved forecast results (`.pkl` files) and generates all tables and figures used in the final paper.\n","- **Configuration:** The `PREDICTION_HORIZON` variable in the configuration cell can be set to `1` or `3` to generate the results for the nowcast or forecast, respectively. The notebook must be run once for each horizon.\n","- **Expected Runtime:** ~2-4 minutes per horizon."],"metadata":{"id":"gRBttYtDSRI0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LvCRfTMKSkuI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
